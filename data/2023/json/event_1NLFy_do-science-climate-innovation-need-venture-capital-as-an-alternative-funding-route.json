    "title": "Do science & climate innovation need venture capital as an alternative funding route?",
    "description": "Scientific research is generally relying on government and public funding bodies to support ideas within a peer-reviewed environment. The climate emergency is the most urgent global crisis beyond boundaries and sector-limits. The speed of which our climate changes, requires urgently to mitigate CO2 emissions. This can be supported by developing novel technical resources, materials, platforms, supply chains etc. beyond the existing academic and political efforts. Venture capital accelerators such as Carbon13 (and others) provide an alternative to fund climate tech developments. This can propel ideas into real-world ventures at exceptional speed. Carbon13\u2019s ventures have already contributed to an annual mitigation of >500 Million tons of CO2e within just 3 years.",
