    "description": "Witness how Ukrainian art and culture have become targets of the ongoing war, and meet the inspiring people on the frontlines protecting it. What happens when museums can no longer show their collections, instead need to hide them? What does it mean to be a street artist during war? What music do you make when your country is under attack? \"You Destroy. We Create\" takes you on an immersive journey through the war-torn country, where artists and professionals from the cultural sphere are busy protecting, rebuilding and creating art. Since the start of the war, civilian deaths have mounted to thousands and over seven million have fled the country. Another casualty has been culture. According to UNESCO over 200 sites of cultural importance have been damaged. This timely journalistic piece uses a combination of 360\u00b0/180\u00b0 stereo videos, drone footage, photogrammetry scans and CG animations to bring you an emotionally engaging, urgent human story.",
